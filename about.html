        <h2>Runner/Administrative Assistant – Gough, Shanahan, Johnson & Waterman LLC</h2>
        <p>Located in Helena, Montana, Gough, Shanahan Johnson & Waterman LLC was Montana’s oldest law firm. Beginning in 2014, I handled the delivery of sensitive and valuable documents to various law firms and legal establishments around the greater Helena area. I was also the librarian for its thousands of law sources until the firm’s unfortunate dissolution in 2015. During my time at Gough, Shanahan, Johnson & Waterman LLC, I was most proud of my project in which I cataloged the firm’s thousands of books, in which I created a virtual reference library for each finding by the attorneys and legal aids. Users could also request the delivery of titles to their desk instantly.</p>

        <h2>Office Assistant – Lewis and Clark County District Court</h2>
        <p>Following my time at Gough, Shanahan, Johnson & Waterman LLC, I began working at the Lewis and Clark County District Court. I assisted in the official document processing of everything from criminal arrest profiles to civil cases. My daily duties included filing processing, organization, research, and fulfillment of public data requests. I worked with the Clerk of Court and my colleagues to start the process of virtualizing the countless documents within the court in order to optimize future filing efficiency.</p>
